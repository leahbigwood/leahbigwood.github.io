Talks

I gave the public lecture 'Shedding Light on the Dark Universe' at the Institute of Astronomy open evening on the 31st January 2024.  A youtube recording of this talk is available [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYX_Hb-acQc).  

Mentoring
---
I was a physics mentor for the ['Levelling Up: Aspire Higher'](https://www.durham.ac.uk/departments/academic/physics/research/levelling-up/) program.  I ran workshops for sixth form students on topics such as minority representation in STEM, the university application process and how to acquire research experience in physics.
